# TV Show updates lambda

[![Build/test/deploy](https://github.com/covertbert/tv-shows-lambda/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/covertbert/tv-shows-lambda/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is a CDK application containing a lambda that notifies me when there are new episodes of my favourite TV shows. I'm sure this functionality exists elsewhere but it was an excuse to create a TypeScript lambda using the CDK.
